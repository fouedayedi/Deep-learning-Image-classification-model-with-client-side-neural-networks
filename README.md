# Deep learning Image classification model with client side neural networks
An image classification project for an e-commerce website is a machine learning project in which a model for classifying images on the website is built and deployed using the Keras and TensorFlow.js libraries. The following are the steps in my project:

### Data Collection: 
In this step, I gathered a dataset of images and labels for the various product categories sold on the website.

### Preparing the Data: 
Next, I prepare the data so that it can be used to train the model. Resizing the images, Data augmentation,Â converting them to a numerical format,
and categorizing the data into training and test sets are all part of this process.

### Model Construction: 
I used Keras to build and train the image classification model on the preprocessed data. Keras is a Python-based high-level neural network API that can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. The model learned to identify various patterns in images and associate them with specific product categories.

### Model Evaluation: 
In this step, I evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. I also used visualization, such as a Classification matrix, to gain a better understanding of the results.

Finally, I used Tensorflow.js to integrate the deployed model into the e-commerce website, allowing it to classify images in real-time.

Additional steps in the project included fine-tuning the model with hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting.
